## `WELCOME FRIENDS 👋`

#### My name is `Basic Mirko` 🐵

**I LOVE what I do!!!** I am a full-stack developer who takes pride in writing extremely clean code and focuses on constant growth. As a web developer, I enjoy using my obsessive attention to detail, my unequivocal love for improvement and my mission-driven work ethic to leave my mark in the field.

I am interested in the entire full-stack spectrum but currently my major focus is on **[React](https://github.com/facebook/react)**. I have skills in other fields like typography, design and modeling. I take visuals of a web site just as seriously as a designer and believe the combination of both form and function is what makes a great user experience.
